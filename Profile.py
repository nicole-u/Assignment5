# You should review this code to identify what features you need to support
# in your program for assignment 2.
#
# YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ THE JSON ASPECTS OF THIS CODE
# NOW, though can you certainly take a look at it if you are curious since we
# already covered a bit of the JSON format in class.
