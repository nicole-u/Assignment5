This Assignment 5 builds off of the Assignment 4 and allows the user to directly message (DM) another user
as long as the first user knows the username of the second user. It also implements a GUI with tkinter so that
messages can be displayed in a window in real time. It also allows the user to add contacts and keeps all the
functionality of the previous assignments.
